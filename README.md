# Series and Sequences

This project is related to important part of calculus: series and sequences.
It consists of two parts:
* ## Series.
In it I investigated convergence of some typical infinite series and their rate of convergence. Also, I represented number Pi in the form of exponential series and applied two method for calculating it.

* ## Functional Series and Sequences.
In this part I investigated, I studied pointwise and uniform convergence of some functional sequences and series.
